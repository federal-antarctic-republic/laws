# Constitution of the Federal Antarctic Republic
**A Constitution to declare the establishment of the Federal Antarctic Republic as a nation on the continent of Antarctica.**

## Preamble
In order to continue democracy, we Antarcticans would like to establish a nation in Antarctica. We believe that nations today will one day fall and democracy must be preserved. We believe that every human has the right to peace, prosperity, and freedom. We believe that with the establishment of this new nation, people can come to our country to escape the persecution or corruption of their home country. We believe that human civilization must be carried out in order to survive. We therefore establish the Federal Antarctic Republic under this constitution to provide the best for its citizens and this Earth.
